        Welcome to my music page! I'm thrilled to have you here. This page was born out of my deep love for music, a passion that has been a constant in my life. Growing up in Toronto, I was fortunate to be exposed to a rich tapestry of sounds and genres, allowing me to develop a profound appreciation for hip hop, R&B, pop, and soft rock. My Latin roots have further enriched my musical journey, instilling in me a love for salsa, merengue, bachata, Latin pop, and reggaet√≥n. Through this page, I hope to share my musical influences and experiences with you, celebrating the diverse world of music that has shaped who I am.
